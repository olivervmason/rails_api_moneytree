# README

This is the backend to the React bootcamp project MoneyTree, the frontend of which is deployed from: https://github.com/ashleybridges01/moneytree.

The plan for this project is documented on the repository https://github.com/olivervmason/T3FinalProjectPlanning.

The only change to that brief was the addition of UUID's using the built in "securerandom" functionality.

Back end testing was performed using postman. A copy of the tests run in JSON format has been included in the file "postman_collection.json"
